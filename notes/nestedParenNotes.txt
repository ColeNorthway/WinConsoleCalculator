NESTED PARENTHESES
<================>

1) Separate every () at the end of the parentheses expression
- lets cut out the rest of the checks and just be like if it finds ( len > 1 do it
- then we gotta get back and instead of cutting that index then dropping when evaluating () we just pop front and back always to simplify in one step
